# NFCPlayground-Android

Android app for trying different tasks using NFC technology.

# Capabilities

- [X] Scan a NFC tag from the home screen of the phone and have it launch the app by a specified Activity (using intent filters).

To get this working, download an app from the Play Store that can write NFC tags (NFC tools is popular). Write to it this URL: `https://app.levibostian.com/code.html?code=111`. You can replace `111` with anything. That part is dynamic.

Install the mobile app to your device. Go to your phone's settings to make sure NFC reading is on. Then, scan your NFC tag you just wrote to on the phone. You should see a dialog popup asking you if you want to launch this app.
